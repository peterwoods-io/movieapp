#  MovieApp by Peter Woods

## Build tools & versions used

XCode 14.3.1, requires iOS 16.4 or later.

Designed for iPhone screen sizes.

## Steps to run the app

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Change the signing settings for the MovieApp target to use your Apple developer account.
3. Build and run!

## Development notes

No third-party dependencies were used. I would likely replace `AsyncImage` with its equivalent in the [Nuke](https://github.com/kean/Nuke) library if better image caching behavior were desired.
